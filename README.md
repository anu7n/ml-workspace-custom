    <strong>All-in-one web-based development environment for machine learning</strong>
</p>

The ML workspace is an all-in-one web-based IDE specialized for machine learning and data science. It is simple to deploy and gets you started within minutes to productively build ML solutions on your own machines. This workspace is the ultimate tool for developers, preloaded with a variety of popular data science libraries (e.g., Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras, Sklearn) and dev tools (e.g., Jupyter, VS Code, Tensorboard) perfectly configured, optimized, and integrated.

ðŸ›  Customizations for BALab (Business Analytics Lab)
- **Self-maintained CUDA version:** Due to the original version not being updated for a long time, this customization ensures that the CUDA version is actively maintained and frequently updated, ensuring compatibility with the latest developments in machine learning.
- **Commitment to updates:** Regular updates to the CUDA version are provided to keep the workspace in sync with the latest tools and technologies.
- **Minimal versions of workspace:** To avoid conflicts related to package dependencies between recent TensorFlow and PyTorch versions, only minimal versions are pre-installed. You can install the latest versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch manually within a virtual environment and set it up as a new kernel.

We strive to keep everything as similar as possible to the original version inside the repository, except for the customized figures/logos in the resources for our lab needs and other updates related to the CUDA version. **For more information and to see the original version, visit: [ml-tooling/ml-workspace.](https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-workspace)**
